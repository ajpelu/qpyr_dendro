Dataset of PÃ©rez-Luque AJ; Gea-Izquierdo G; Zamora R (Accepted). Land-use legacies and climate change as a double challenge to oak forest resilience: mismatches of geographical and ecological rear edges. Ecosystems


This dataset contains the followings data: 
- Metadata_fields. A csv with metadata description of the file variables.
- Tree-ring measurements of the focal trees (in rwl files, tucson format).
- Forest inventory data. Distance, azimuth, diameter at breast height (DBH), species, and total height of all neighboring living trees with DBH > 7.5 cm within a circular plot with a 10-m radius around target (focal) trees. 
- Focal tree measurement. Diameter at breast height (DBH), species, and total height of the focal trees. 
- Annual EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) mean of pixels (250 m x 250 m) covering Quercus pyrenaica forests in Sierra Nevada (southern Spain). Data were derived from MOD13Q1 product of the MODIS sensor. MODIS EVI data were compiled for the period 2000 - 2016. We selected the pixels covering the distribution of Quercus pyrenaica forests in Sierra Nevada (n = 928 pixels). Any values affected by clouds, snow, shadows or high content aerosols, were filtered out following recommendations for mountain regions.
