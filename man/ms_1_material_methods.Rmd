# Materials and methods 

## Species and study site 

The Pyrenean oak (*Quercus pyrenaica* Willd.) forests extend through south-western France and the Iberian Peninsula [@Franco1990] reaching its southern limit in north of Morocco. In the Iberian Peninsula these forests live under meso-supramediterranean and mesotemperate areas and subhumid, humid and hyperhumid ombroclimate [@RivasMartinez2002] living on siliceous soils, or soils poor in basic ions [@Vilches2014]. *Q. pyrenaica* requires between 650 and 1200 mm of annual precipitation and a summer minimal precipitation between 100 and 200 mm (Martínez-Parras and Molero-Mesa 1982, García and Jiménez 2009), with summer rainfall being a key factor in the distribution of the species (Gavilán et al. 2007, Río et al. 2007).

This species reaches its southernmost European limit at Sierra Nevada, a high-mountain range located in southern Spain (37°N, 3°W) with elevations of between 860 m and 3482 m a.s.l. The climate is Mediterranean, characterized by cold winters and hot summers, with pronounced summer drought (July-August). There are eight oak patches (2400 Has) identified (:red_circle: FIGURE) in this mountain range, ranging between 1100 and 2000 *m a.s.l.* and generally associated to major river valleys. Sierra Nevada is considered a glacial refugia for deciduous *Quercus* species during glaciation (Brewer et al. 2002, Olalde et al. 2002, Rodríguez-Sánchez et al. 2010) and these populations are considered as a rear edge of the habitat distribution, which is important in determining habitat responses to expected climate change (Hampe and Petit 2005).

:red_circle: `duda aqui` Varias referencias hablan de los años 2005 y 2012 como  extremadamente secos. Pero habría que hacer alguna referencia y/o análisis. Tengo dudas de si hemos de analizar (e incluir) que efectivamente los años 2005 y 2012 fueron caracterizados por un extrema sequía, por lo que habría que  incluyendo referencia a apéndice

The populations of Pyrenean oak forests at Sierra Nevada are considered relict forests (Melendo and Valle 2000, Vivero et al. 2000), undergoing intensive anthropic use in the last few decades (Camacho-Olmedo et al. 2002, Valbuena-Carabaña et al. 2010). In fact, the status of conservation of this species for southern Spain is "Vulnerable" (Vivero et al. 2000). The relict presence of this species in Sierra Nevada is related both to its genetic resilience as well as to its high intraspecific genetic diversity (Valbuena-Carabaña and Gil 2013). However, they are also expected to suffer the impact of climate change, due to their climate requirements (wet summers). Thus, simulations of the climate change effects on this habitat forecast a reduction in suitable habitats for Sierra Nevada (Benito et al. 2011).

## Datos de sequía.

### Greenness data 

To characterize the vegetation greeness we used the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from MOD13Q1 product obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor [@Didan2015]. EVI product consits of 16-day maximun value composite images (23 per year) of the EVI value with a spatial resolution of 231 m x 231 m.  


EVI junto con NDVI ha sido utilizado para cuantificar la productividad primaria ... No obstante we used EVI instead of NDVI because it is more sensitive to change in high-biomass areas; EVI reduces the influence of atmospheric conditions on vegetation index values, and EVI corrects for canopy background signals [@Huete2002, @Krapivin2015]. 

NDVI sirve para estimar la producción primaria neta. Existen diferentes estudio que han evaluado el efecto de la sequía sobre la producción primaria neta utilizando NDVI. 


Data were obtained using a Google Earth Engine script (:red_circle: cite gists) for the 2000 - 2015 period. The EVI data are geometrically and atmospherically corrected and include information about the quality ass....

These data are geometrically and atmospherically corrected, and include an index of data quality (reliability, which range from 0 – good quality data – to 4 – raw data or absent for different reasons) based on the environmental conditions in which the data was recorded

We first used the Quality Assesment (QA band) information of this product to filter out those values affected by high content of aerosols, clouds, shadows, snow or water; and then a quality assessment was carried out to filter the ... [@Reyes2015] 

:red_circle: reescribir esto de la calidad. 

After the filter out process, we built the annual EVI profile for each pixel and then computed the EVI's annual mean values and the EVI anomaly for each pixel for the period 2000 - 2015. 

## Field sampling and dendrochronological methods 

### Tree sampling 
Samplig was carried during autumn of 2016. Trees were sampled at two locations located in contrasting slopes of Sierra Nevada: San Juan (SJ; northern site) and Cáñar (CA; southern site) (Table 1). Both sites were oak monospecific and representatives of two of the three the population's cluster identified for the specie in this mountain range (:red_circle: mejorar; citar Pérz-Luque et al..). In each site between 15 and 20 dominant trees were randomly selected. Two cores of 5 mm of diameter were taken per tree at 1.3 m using an increment borer. Diameter at breat height (DBH) and total height were recorded for each tree. Increment cores were air dried, glued onto wooden mounts and sanded. Annual radial growth (ring width, RW) were measured with a LINTAB measuring device (:red_circle: Rinntech 2003) coupled to a stereomicroscope, with an accuracy of 0.01 mm. Individual ring series were visually and statistically cross-dated with TSAP software (:red_circle: Frank Rinn, Heidelberg, Germany), using the statistics Gleichläufigkeit (GLK), t-value and the crossdating index (CDI). Validation of the croos-dating was done using COFECHA software [@Holmes1983].

We built chronologies for each site (two) 


Site chronologies were built by averaging all tree BAI measurement of the same site. To explore similarity within locality, each site chronology was smoothed using centred moving averages with different window sizes, and then Pearson's correlation coefficient between the two chronologies of the same locality (higher and lower elevation) were calculated. Significance was tested using 1000 boostrap replicates and with 95 % confidence intervals built using the R packgae `boot` [@Canty2016]

## Resilience 

To evaluate the effects of the disturbance events on greeennes and tree growth we used four resilience indices proposed by @Lloret2011: resilience (*Rs*), resistance, recovery (*Rc*) and relative resilience (*RRs*). We computed the values of these indices for tree growth and greenness during each drought event. We considered 2005 and 2012 as a single drought event. 

The resistance index (*Rt*) quantifies the severity of the impact of the disturbance in the year it occurred. It is estimated as the ratio between the performance during and befor the disturbance:

Resistance (*Rt*) = Drought / Predrought

The Recovery index (*Rc*) is the ability to recover relative to the damage experienced during disturbance, and it is estimated as the ratio between performance after and during disturbance: 

Recovery (*Rc*) = Postdrought / Drought

The Resilience index (*Rs*) is the capacity to reach pre-disturbance performance levels, and it is estimated as the ratio between the performance after and before disturbance: Resilience (*Rs*)
