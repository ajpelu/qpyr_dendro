Ring Width measurement
======================

Notes from (Gea-Izquierdo et al. 2012)
--------------------------------------

-   Two cores were taken at 1.30 m from each selected tree
-   The stem diamenter and tree height were measured
-   Cores were air dried, fixed in woodend mounts, sanded and RW measured
-   Ring-width series were visually cross-dated and the dating was checked using COFECHA `$TODO$` Check COFECHA
-   Ring-width inidces were obtained by removing the age trend using 30-year individual splines and autocorrelation before computing the final indices using the ration between the observed and expected annual mean growth

Features of vascular system of *Q. pyrenaica*
=============================================

-   Ring-porous tress are assumed to be particularly sensitive to climate warming, because they operate with narrow hydraulic safety margins (see Choat et al. )(Pérez-de-Lis et al. 2016)
