Dear Editor,

Thanks for your mail about our manuscript (MS# ECO-19-0444). Following your recommendation, we have made a review of the English in our manuscript. We have assisted from a native speaker with professional expertise in scientific writing.

We would like to emphasize that in our revision of the text, we have made some changes that we consider important to transmit our message in a clearer and more concise way. Specifically:

1. We changed the title of our manuscript to: "Land-use legacies and climate change as a double challenge to oak forest resilience: mismatches of geographical and ecological rear edges". We think this new title highlight the main message of our manuscript.
2. We improved the writing of the abstract, summarizing it and including more relevant information about our results.
3. We rewrote our main hypothesis making it more clear and direct.
4. We removed some redundant sentences throughout the manuscript, particularly in the discussion.

We sincerely hope you will find our revised manuscript appealing and suitable for publication in Ecosystems.

Best Regards,

Antonio J. PÃ©rez-Luque
