Aims
----

`$IMPROVE$`

In this study we combined remote sensing information and dendroecological methods to evaluate the drought impacts in both greenees and growth of *Q. pyrenaica* forests in Sierra Nevada. Specifically,

The aims of this work were:

-   To evaluate how extreme drought events affected the greennes and growth of *Q. pyreancia* forests in ther rear edge,

-   to analyze the resilience of these forests to sucessive extrme drought events,
-   and to explore differences in the resilience metrics between populations located in contrasting slopes within the rear edge of the distribution of this species.
