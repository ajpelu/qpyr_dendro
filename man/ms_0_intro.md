Intro
=====

-   The vegetation response to water deficit was assessed using remote sensing information and dendrocronologial data.

### Remote sensing

-   Uso de Remote sensing para estudiar la sequía --&gt; Leer Zhang et al. (2013) y escribir algo. Drought monitoring using remote-sensing approach was originally applied to agriculture. Several remote-sensing derived indices have been used to study the drought effects on vegetation ...

### Sequías

Although summer drought is a characteristic feature of the Mediterranean climate (Lionello 2012), an increase in the frequency and severity of drought events have been recorded for the Mediterranean region (Hoerling et al. 2012), particularly for southern Europe (Vicente-Serrano et al. 2014, Spinoni et al. 2015, Stagge et al. 2017) where a trend towards drier summers has been reported for the last three decades (Spinoni et al. 2017a).

In the Iberian Peninsula, major drought episodies were recorded in 1981, 1995, 2000 and 2005 (Vicente-Serrano et al. 2014). The 2004/2005 and 2011/2012 hydrological years are considered two of the worst drought periods recorded in the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in the southern sector (García-Herrera et al. 2007, Trigo et al. 2013, Gouveia et al. 2015). These events were extreme in both its magnitude and spatial extent (Gouveia and Trigo 2014).

> -   Seasonally, drought frequency is projected to increase everywhere in Europe for both scenarios in spring and summer, especially over southern Europe, and less intensely in autumn (Spinoni et al. 2017b) Aumento de la frecuencia de sequías en spring and summer desde 1950 hasta 2014 (Spinoni et al. 2017a) Both for frequency and severity, the evolution towards drier conditions is more relevant in the last three decades over Mediterranean area in summer, an increase in the drought severity in the Iberian Peninsula has been observed in the last decades (Vicente-Serrano et al. 2014).

frecuencia de las sequías severas (ver Dai 2011)

Althought several works have reported these two years as some of the worst drought events, we characterised the drought at several spatio-temporal scales in the study area. From a long-term perspective, we compare the accumulated monthly precipitation at a meteorological station (Granada, Base Aérea) during the hydrological years 2004-2005 and 2011-2012 with the average of accumulated monthly precipitation for the period 1950-2015.

-   Como la dendro ayuda a evaluar las sequías (ver Gazol 2017)

Extreme climate events (as droughts, heatwaves) severely affect forests and grasslands throuhg changes in plant physiology, phenology and carbon allocation (Ummenhofer and Meehl 2017).

Droughts are most likely to have the largest and most long-lasting impacts globally due to large indirect and lagged impacts and long recovery especially for forest ecosystems (ver 18 en Ummenhofer and Meehl (2017))

### 

Uso de NDVI como estimador de la NPP:

-   The NDVI properties have allowed the use of this information for estimating the Net Primary Production (NPP) (Goward and Dye, 1987; Running et al., 2004; Hasenauer et al., 2012). Different studies have already found a strong relationship between NPP and radial growth (e.g., Granier et al., 2008; Babst et al., 2013, 2014a, 2014b; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2015), albeit with significant differences, particularly those related to species, sites and environmental conditions.

### Aims

`$IMPROVE$`

In this study we combined remote sensing information and dendroecological methods to evaluate the drought impacts in both greenees and growth of *Q. pyrenaica* forests in Sierra Nevada. Specifically,

The aims of this work were:

-   To quantify how two extreme drought events influenced the greennes and radial growth of *Q. pyreancia* forests in their rear edge,

-   to analyze the resilience of these forests to sucessive extrme drought events,

-   and to explore differences in the resilience metrics between populations located in contrasting slopes within the rear edge of the distribution of this species.
