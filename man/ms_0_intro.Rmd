# Intro 

* The vegetation response to water deficit was assessed using remote sensing information and dendrocronologial data. 


Ideas a expresar 

### Remote sensing 

* Uso de Remote sensing para estudiar la sequía --> Leer @Zhang2013 y escribir algo. Drought monitoring using remote-sensing approach was originally applied to agriculture. Several remote-sensing derived indices have been used to study the drought effects on vegetation ...

### Ideas a incluir 

* Descripción de las sequía de 2005 y 2014


La sequía es una característica del clima mediterráneo [@Lionello2012], pero en los últimos años se ha venido observando un aumento de la frecuencia y la severidad de los periodos de sequía (:red_circle: CITA; @VicenteSerrano2014 para la P. Iberica). 

The 2004/2005 and 2011/2012 hydrological years are considered two of the worst drought periods recorded in the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in the southeren sector [@GarciaHerrera2007; @Gouveia2015; @Trigo2013]. These events were extreme in both its magnitude and spatial extent [@Gouveia2014]. 


an increase in the drought severity in the Iberian Peninsula has been observed in the last decades [@VicenteSerrano2014]. 


Althought several works have reported these two years as some of the worst drought events, we characterised the drought at several spatio-temporal scales in the study area. From a long-term perspective, we compare the accumulated monthly precipitation at a meteorological station (Granada, Base Aérea) during the hydrological years 2004-2005 and 2011-2012 with the average of accumulated monthly precipitation for the period 1950-2015.

### 
Uso de NDVI como estimador de la NPP: 

* The NDVI properties have allowed the use of this information for estimating the Net Primary Production (NPP) (Goward and Dye, 1987; Running et al., 2004; Hasenauer et al., 2012). Different studies have already found a strong relationship between NPP and radial growth (e.g., Granier et al., 2008; Babst et al., 2013, 2014a, 2014b; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2015), albeit with significant differences, particularly those related to species, sites and environmental conditions.

### Aims
`$IMPROVE$`

In this study we combined remote sensing information and dendroecological methods to evaluate the drought impacts in both greenees and growth of *Q. pyrenaica* forests in Sierra Nevada. Specifically, 

The aims of this work were: 

* To quantify how two extreme drought events influenced the greennes and radial growth of *Q. pyreancia* forests in their rear edge,

* to analyze the resilience of these forests to sucessive extrme drought events,

* and to explore differences in the resilience metrics between populations located in contrasting slopes within the rear edge of the distribution of this species.
