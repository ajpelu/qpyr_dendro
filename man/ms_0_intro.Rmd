# Intro 

* The vegetation response to water deficit was assessed using remote sensing information and dendrocronologial data. 


Ideas a expresar 

### Remote sensing 

* Uso de Remote sensing para estudiar la sequía --> Leer @Zhang2013 y escribir algo. Drought monitoring using remote-sensing approach was originally applied to agriculture. Several remote-sensing derived indices have been used to study the drought effects on vegetation ...

### Sequías 

Although summer drought is a characteristic feature of the Mediterranean climate [@Lionello2012], an increase in the frequency and severity of drought events have been recorded for the Mediterranean region [@Hoerling2011], particularly for southern Europe [@VicenteSerrano2014; @Spinoni2015; @Stagge2017] where a trend towards drier summers has been reported for the last three decades [@Spinoni2017b].

In the Iberian Peninsula, major drought episodies were recorded in 1981, 1995, 2000 and 2005 [@VicenteSerrano2014]. The 2004/2005 and 2011/2012 hydrological years are considered two of the worst drought periods recorded in the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in the southern sector [@GarciaHerrera2007; @Gouveia2015; @Trigo2013]. These events were extreme in both its magnitude and spatial extent [@Gouveia2014].

frecuencia de las sequías severas (ver Dai 2011)




Althought several works have reported these two years as some of the worst drought events, we characterised the drought at several spatio-temporal scales in the study area. From a long-term perspective, we compare the accumulated monthly precipitation at a meteorological station (Granada, Base Aérea) during the hydrological years 2004-2005 and 2011-2012 with the average of accumulated monthly precipitation for the period 1950-2015.



* Extreme sequias y ecologia 
* Como la dendro ayuda a evaluar las sequías (ver Gazol 2017)

Extreme climate events (as droughts, heatwaves) severely affect forests and grasslands throuhg changes in plant physiology, phenology and carbon allocation [@Ummenhofer2017]. 

Droughts are most likely to have the largest and most long-lasting impacts globally due to large indirect and lagged impacts and long recovery especially for forest ecosystems (ver  18 en @Ummenhofer2017)



### 
Uso de NDVI como estimador de la NPP: 

* The NDVI properties have allowed the use of this information for estimating the Net Primary Production (NPP) (Goward and Dye, 1987; Running et al., 2004; Hasenauer et al., 2012). Different studies have already found a strong relationship between NPP and radial growth (e.g., Granier et al., 2008; Babst et al., 2013, 2014a, 2014b; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2015), albeit with significant differences, particularly those related to species, sites and environmental conditions.

### Aims
`$IMPROVE$`

In this study we combined remote sensing information and dendroecological methods to evaluate the drought impacts in both greenees and growth of *Q. pyrenaica* forests in Sierra Nevada. Specifically, 

The aims of this work were: 

* To quantify how two extreme drought events influenced the greennes and radial growth of *Q. pyreancia* forests in their rear edge,

* to analyze the resilience of these forests to sucessive extrme drought events,

* and to explore differences in the resilience metrics between populations located in contrasting slopes within the rear edge of the distribution of this species.
