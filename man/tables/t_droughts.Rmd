##### 
**Appendix S3.** Drought events for Sierra Nevada based on SPEI index (12 months scale). A drought event starts in the month when SPEI falls below the threshold of -1.28 [@Pascoa2017]. A drought event is considered only when SPEI value are below threshold for at least two consecutive months [*e.g.* @Spinoni2015; @Spinoni2017a; @Pascoa2017]. The ***duration*** of a drought event is the number of consecutive months with the SPEI lower than a certain threshold. ***Severity*** of a drought event is the sum of the SPEI values (absolute values) during the duration of the drought event. ***Intensity*** and ***Lowest SPEI*** refer to the mean and lowest value of SPEI respectively during the drought event duration. SPEI data were obtained for all 0.5ยบ grid cells covering Sierra Nevada.  

```{r}
# peores sequias 
dy <- read.csv(file=here::here('data/sequias', 'severe_spei12.csv'), header=TRUE)
dy <- dy %>% arrange(desc(d_duration))
# solamente aquellos mayor de 2 meses 
dys <- dy %>% 
  filter(d_duration > 2) %>%  
  mutate(year = ifelse(minyear == maxyear, 
                       minyear, 
                       paste0(minyear, '-', maxyear))) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-minyear, -maxyear, -cat, -month_peak) %>% 
  as.data.frame()
